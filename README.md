Engineering Extended Project Qualification (EPQ)
================================================

## What is this?

This is the code and writeup for an [Extended Project Qualification (EPQ)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Project_Qualification) I'm currently doing.
The aim of the project is to build a system for *indoor navigation* that could work in environments like office buildings, schools, and museums
where there is no GPS reception inside, but your building is sufficiently complex that a navigation system might be useful.

## Nice. How's it going?

Well, it's not finished yet, and has to be by 2019-03-25. Better get cracking. (Don't worry, I do have a plan, sort of.)

## What technologies does it use?

- React Native for the mobile app thingy
- Rust for the routing server, probably
- LyX and BibTeX for the writeup
